Hi, Rol.
It's Vicki Henderson from Neon Engineering.
I'd like to thank you for coming to visit this morning.
We all thought your presentation was very interesting.
It also seems you have the experience we need,
and we were impressed by your knowledge of current technologies, too.
So we'd like to ask you to come for the final stage of interviews next week.
Please call me to discuss a suitable time as soon as you can.
