Okay, it's almost one o'clock. I'm going out to get a sandwich.
I can get one for you too if you like.
That's very kind of you. Thank you.
Could you get me a ham and cheese from the coffee shop on the corner?
Okay. Do you want anything to drink?
A regular coffee, thanks.
Wait a minute and I'll give you the money.

Diane, do you think you'll get that work done by five o'clock?
By five? No way. There's too much to do. It'll have to wait until Monday.
Would you mind staying late tonight and finishing it? It's very urgent. I can pay you overtime.
Sorry, but I have plans. I'm meeting some friends for dinner.

Hello, no rain. How can I help you?
I need a new monitor. Mine is starting to cause problems and it's way too small.
Do we have a budget for this kind of thing?
Not at the moment. Money is very tight. I can give you my monitor if you want. We can swap.
Well, you're not at your desk as much as me, so...okay? Yes. Let's do that.

Are you waiting for Mrs. Aiten?
Yes. We have a meeting at 4, but it seems she's a little late.
Yes. I think it's the traffic. I'll call her on her cell phone to check. Would you like some tea or coffee while you wait?

Excuse me. Are you using this?
No, that one's free. I just need two for my friends. They'll be here any minute.
Okay. Well, I'm with some people over there in the corner and we need one more chair.
Do you mind if I take this one?
Sure. Go ahead.

We've been good customers of yours for a year now.
Yes, that's right. I hope you're happy with our service and our products.
Do you feel you're getting good value for your money?
Well, that's what I want to ask you about. I've been comparing prices on the internet and you're not that competitive, to be honest.
We'd like to stay with you, but could you give 10% off all future orders?
Oh, I see. I'll have to ask my boss about that.
