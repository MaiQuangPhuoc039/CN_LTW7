Questions about plans.
1.
At last it's Friday.
What a week!
I'm glad we finished that report.
Let's enjoy ourselves this weekend.
The weather forecast is good.
So why don't we play tennis tomorrow?
Okay, and on Sunday we can go for a long walk in the country.
That sounds like a good plan.
1. What are the speakers planning to do over the weekend?

Hi Carol. This is your last month.
Do you know what you're going to do after this contract is over?
Yes, I'm going to apply for a permanent position here.
I really like working with you all.
That's great.
But I thought you wanted to work in Vancouver.
No, I've changed my mind. Toronto is much nicer.

Can you check the price of these memory sticks please?
Certainly. One moment.
They're $8.49 each. Do you want all three?
Yes please.
Oh, I don't have enough cash. Is a credit card okay?
Sure, no problem.
3. How will the man pay?
4.
Which one do you think I should get?
The red or the blue dress? Or maybe that skirt over there?
The black one? That looks good. But you have a lot of skirts already.
Yes, you're right. Okay, so if it's for work then the blue is a little more suitable I think.
I agree. Let's hurry up and pay.
4. What will the woman probably buy?
5.
Fiona, we'd like to offer you the job. Will you accept?
I'd love to. Thanks. Oh, I'll have to tell my current employer, of course.
Yes, of course. So you intend to give a month's notice there?
That's right. I can't just leave immediately. That means I should be free to start here four weeks from next Monday.
5. What does Fiona plan to do?

Due to the economic slowdown, we're going to have to close our Munich branch next year.
Oh, that's terrible. What about all the staff who work there? Will they lose their jobs?
Some will be offered work in New York or London, but the majority will have to go, I'm afraid.
I wonder how our investors will take this news.
6. What is the company planning to do?
