And now we come to the Impressionist Rooms.
Here you will find the finest paintings from the early to late Impressionist period.
We can see on the left here a marvellous example by Monet,
and over there in front of you is a Renoir.
Altogether you will find over 60 paintings,
so please feel free to ask questions if you wish.
