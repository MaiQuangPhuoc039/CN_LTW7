Hello. I work in a small accounting firm and we're interested in a website. I saw your
ad in a local newspaper. Can you tell me how much it would cost?
Ah, well, that depends on what you want. I'm guessing you won't want e-commerce or anything
too fancy.
Oh no, just something simple to give us an online presence. The cheaper the better,

Hmm, I see. Well, our basic package costs from $3,000. That's for a maximum of 20 pages
with photos. I can put you through to one of our team of designers if you'd like to find
