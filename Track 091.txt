Questions about the audience?

Okay, so it's almost 3 o'clock.
Our next stop today is Battery Park, where we will board the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.
This is the last destination in our tour today, and of course is one of the most famous landmarks in the world.
We'll have two hours to look around before catching the ferry back here at 6 o'clock.
Okay, so please make sure you have all your valuables with you before you get off.
