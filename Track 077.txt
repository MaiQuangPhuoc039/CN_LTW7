Practice questions with a graphic.
Listen to eight short conversations.
For each conversation, look at the graphic and choose one statement.
A, B, C, or D that best answers the question.
One.
Hello. I'd like a ticket to Edgeware, please.
Sure thing. That'll be $5.
Thanks a lot. When's the next train?
Five o'clock. You'd better hurry.
One. Look at the graphic.
Which platform does the man need to go to?
Two.
I went to a place called Ken's Coffee Shop yesterday.
Across from the park. Do you know it?
Oh, yes. I've seen it, but I've never been in.
What did you have?
I just had the cheesecake they're famous for it, apparently.
So how was it?
It was really good.
Two. Look at the graphic. How much did the man most likely pay?
Three.
Do you know where Peter is?
Sorry. I have no idea. He might be off sick today.
At least I haven't seen him.
So who do I send the latest time sheets to? They need to be in today.
I'd say maybe Tony. Why don't you call him to check?
Okay. I'll do that.
Three. Look at the graphic. What extension will the woman call?
Four.
And here's your room key. You're in room 24. Welcome to the Bellevue Hotel.
Thank you. Can you tell me if there's a gym here?
Yes. We have a gym on the fifth floor. It's open 24-7 so you can go any time.
Thank you. And is there a restaurant?
Yes. The brasserie Mosh 2. It's very popular. Shall I book you a table?
Yes, please. Eight o'clock. A table for three.
Four. Look at the graphic. Where does this conversation take place?
Five.
Are you going to Dr. Kleber's talk later, Harry?
Yes. I'm looking forward to it. It's at 1.30 in the Pembroke Suite, right?
No. Didn't you hear the announcement? They're repainting the Pembroke Suite.
Really? So where's Dr. Kleber's talk?
It'll be in the same room as Dr. Parsons. His talk finishes at 1, so Dr. Kleber's talk will start as scheduled at 1.30.
Five. Look at the graphic. Where will Dr. Kleber's talk take place?
Six. Hello. I have a meeting with Mr. Watson at 5 o'clock. The name's Jaden Krag.
Okay. Let me just see in our visitor file here. No. We're not expecting anyone. You're here to see who? Mr. Watson?
That's right. We don't have anyone working here with that name.
Oh, hang on. I think I know what's happened. This is lifestyle insurance. You need the next floor up. I'm pretty sure Mr. Watson works up there.
Oh, okay. Thank you. Sorry for the mistake. Six. Look at the graphic. Which company does the man want to visit?
Seven.
Sam?
Eight?
Seven?
It's Gina.
Hi, Gina. Where are you?
I'm right outside the mall. Where are you?
I'm in the diner. Isn't that where we were supposed to meet?
No. You said the mall. Anyway, how do I get there?
Turn left and walk past the city hall. It's across the street next to the bank.
Okay. I'll be there soon. You owe me a coffee, Sam.
Seven. Look at the graphic. Where is Sam?
Eight?
Carol, do you think I could take tomorrow off?
What? Again. You had two days off last week.
I know, but... And tomorrow's the busiest day of our week. I'll need you.
I know, but the weather forecast isn't good and it's my birthday. I've been working hard all summer. I need a break.
Oh, okay. I suppose I'll manage on my own.
Eight. Look at the graphic. On which day does this conversation take place?
