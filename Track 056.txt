Sorry, Katie. Can you tell me when I'm seeing Dr. Nichols? I can't remember.
No problem. Let me just check in the diary. That's at 3 p.m. on Friday.

I hope the weather improves.
I checked and they say it is going to be warmer from tomorrow.
Well, that's a relief. And I suppose he is the senior engineer on this project, so I can't avoid going.
1. What is the conversation mainly about?
2. What does the man imply about Dr. Nichols?
3. Look at the graphic. On what day does this conversation take place?
