Are you going out?

How's the new job? Are you enjoying it?
Yes, but it's hard work. I hurt my back lifting a package this morning onto the scales. It was really heavy.
Couldn't anyone help you?
No, everyone was busy. It's always busy on Mondays. I filled six huge bags of mail and sold around 300 stamps before lunch.

I'd like a car for a few days. What do you have? Small is okay.
Well, we have a compact available. That's the most economical.
That's fine. How much is it for the weekend? Including insurance.
Okay, give me a minute and I'll get you a price.

Hello, Mr Wilkinson. How are you?
Not too good, actually. I have a toothache in the back on the side, right about here.
Sit back in the chair and let me take a look. Open wide.
Oh, yes, I see the problem. Hmm. I need to do something about this right away.
