Listening for main ideas. Example.
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for coming.
I have called this board meeting because I need to tell you some disappointing news.
As you know, recent months here at Arc Pharmaceuticals have not been easy.
Orders are currently 50% less than they were at the same time last year.
What's more, today I heard from Benson's, our biggest client, that they are going out of business.
We can expect tough times ahead.
However, since I started this company 30 years ago, we have overcome many challenges.
I believe we have the best product on the market and that we can survive.
