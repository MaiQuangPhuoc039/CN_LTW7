Listening for details, example one, a typical conversation.
Good morning. This is Helen from Boston Office Supplies.
Oh, yes. Hello.
We have a promotion this month. We have solid oak desks for just $199 and our ambassador office chairs are half price.
That sounds good.
Um, well, some of the chairs here are pretty old. How much are the ones you mentioned?
The ambassador chairs are just $80 right now.
Really?
They're leather and come with a five-year warranty. Why don't you order now while the shipping is free?
One. How long does the promotion last?
Two. What does the woman suggest the man do?
Three. What does the man think of the promotion?
