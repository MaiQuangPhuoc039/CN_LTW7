Part 3. Steps to Success. Practice 3.
Excuse me. I bought this notebook PC from you last week for my daughter.
But it doesn't seem to work properly. There's something wrong with it.
I can't use the internet and the screen keeps going black so I have to restart all the time.
I'm sick of it.
Oh, okay. Sorry about that. Leave it with us and we'll take a look.
How long will that take?
Well, it's hard to say. Can you come back on Friday?

Sorry, but we're very busy. You can call on Thursday if you want. It might be ready then.
