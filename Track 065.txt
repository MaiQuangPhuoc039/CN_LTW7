Yes, if you're all right with that. Don't you want to take a taxi?
No need. The stop's right outside their place. I have a quick meeting with Steve from accounts at half past 12.
I'll head straight over after that.
One. What does the woman ask the man to do?
Two. What will the man do later?
Three. Look at the graphic. Which bus will the man most likely take?
