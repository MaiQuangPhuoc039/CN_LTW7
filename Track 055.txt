Part 3, try it out.
Example 3.
A conversation between three speakers.
How was the trade show, guys?
Did you enjoy it?
I'll say, there were a lot of new products on display.
Plenty of things I hadn't seen before, actually.
Yeah, and almost all our rivals were exhibiting there.
Out of interest, why didn't we have a stand, Nick?
I was thinking we would, but the cheapest they had was over $8,000.
What?
Just for two days.
That's incredible.
Yeah, I couldn't really justify that kind of expense, but maybe next year.
