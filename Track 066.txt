Questions about time?
One.
It's Friday already, and we still haven't finished this project.
I'll be glad when it's over.
I know. It's almost three months now.
Well, we should be able to finish it next week, hopefully.
Hopefully. I'm looking forward to it.
Anyway, have a good weekend. I'll see you on Monday.

I don't think this cell phone is working properly.
You only bought it two weeks ago, didn't you?
Why don't you take it back to the store?
I haven't had time this week. I've been too busy.
Maybe you'll get the chance over the weekend.

When did the man buy his cell phone?

When does the lecture on telephone cells begin?
I think it starts at three. It's in training room B this time.
It finishes at four, right? I have a meeting then.
No. This one lasts for two hours. You'll have to reschedule your four o'clock appointment.

When are you going to sign the Franklin contract?
There's no rush. It's only Tuesday. We aren't seeing them until Thursday.
Yes, but I promised Mr. Franklin he would have it before the weekend.
Really? I didn't know that.
Okay, I'll do it right away.
Four. When will the woman sign the contract?
Five.
Say, Tony, have you lost weight?
Yes, I have. Thanks for noticing. I started going to the gym a few months ago.
Well, it seems to be working. Do you go every day?
No. They say you need to go three times a week, but I just go on Mondays and Fridays.
Five. How often does Tony go to the gym?
Six.
I haven't sent this package yet, and it's 5.30 already.
Well, why don't you leave it until tomorrow? It's not urgent, is it?
I guess not, but I wanted to do it today.
I'd leave it and do it right away when you get in tomorrow. That'll be okay.
Six. How soon will the order be shipped?
