Oh, Mr. Perry, before you go into your office, Mr. Watson called while you were at lunch.
Oh, really? I wasn't expecting a call from him. He's due to be here at 3, isn't he?
Yes, that's why he called. He said he can't make it this afternoon. He wanted to reschedule for tomorrow, so I booked him in at 10 a.m. I hope that's okay with you.
Yes, that's fine. Thanks for letting me know.

Questions 4 through 6 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.
I'm glad that's over. I'm exhausted.
So am I. How did yours go, Lisa? Not too bad, I guess.
But it was much tougher than I expected, and longer too.
Hmm, it seems like a great place to work though. If they offer me a position, I'll certainly take it.
Don't hold your breath. I counted over 30 of us for three jobs.
Yeah, well good luck. You never know.
Anyway, we'd better go to the main entrance. There's a bus there to take everyone to the station. It's leaving in 10 minutes.

Of course. Room 412, an early morning call at 6.30.
That's booked for you. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Nope, that's all. Thank you. Good night.

Oh no, don't tell me the photocopy is broken again.
I'm afraid so. It just stopped working a minute ago. It's not out of paper. I checked that already.
I'm not sure what the problem is to be honest.
Typical. My class starts in five minutes. I need to copy this test.
Well, why don't you call Bob? He should be able to fix it.
10. Where does this conversation take place?
11. What is the problem?
12. Look at the graphic. What extension number will the woman call?
