Listening for details.
Example 1.
A typical short talk.
Hello Amy, it's James.
Can you email everyone about the training seminar next week please?
It's urgent and I'm in meetings all day.
The seminar is on Thursday the 15th in room 12.
The morning session will run from 9 to 12 and focus on customer service and improving
our support to our top clients.
Roy Gosling, the Human Resources Director, will lead that session.
In the afternoon, our Chairman Liz Simmons will be presenting our strategic company goals
and then there will be a leadership exercise and finally a review of sales targets.
That will run from 2 until 6.
Tell everyone to make sure they attend.
Thanks a lot.
