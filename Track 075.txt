I can't believe they cancelled the order.
I know.
They just called an hour ago.
But I was there for three days negotiating that.
We gave them everything they asked for.
We couldn't have done any more.
I know.
But they say they don't want it now.
Perhaps they got a better offer from somewhere else?

Yes, the bill is correct.
Really? I know what I had, but I'm amazed at the cost.
I don't have enough cash.
Would you like to pay by credit card?

How long have you worked here, Brian?

I just went online to reorder the office supplies, and it looks like they've increased the cost again.
Are you sure?
Yes, the green files we get are now 30% more expensive than they were just two months ago,
and the stationery is nearly doubled.
I don't believe it.
Well, I think we should start looking elsewhere.
I'm already on it.

So this year's good cause is Barney's Night Shelter.
Oh, I see.
It's a refuge for homeless over on Barnaby Street.
Yeah, I think I know it.
It opened last year, right?
Yes, they've been asking us to donate ever since.
I think they do good work there.
Hmm, but what about pets at home?
I thought we were supporting them.
Maybe next year.
