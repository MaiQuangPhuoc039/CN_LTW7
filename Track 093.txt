Why not walk or cycle on weekends?
Or take up a hobby like golf or tennis?
More exercise means a healthier and longer life.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome your attention, please.
We are here today to show our appreciation to Dr. Williams for all his hard work over the past 37 years.
Dr. Williams has been with us since this research facility opened.
His hard work, dedication and enthusiasm are an example to us all.
It is therefore with great regret that we have to say goodbye to him.
However, he takes with him our warmest wishes for a long and happy future ahead.
