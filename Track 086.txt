Part 4. Try it out. Example 2. A short talk, including a graphic.
Good morning everyone. I need to tell you about a change to our program today. Dr. Carlton is running late.
Apparently, the road works on the A14 again and traffic is a nightmare, so no surprises there.
He expects to be here in an hour or so, but can't confirm exactly when. We wish him well.
Luckily, Professor Samuels has agreed to swap places with him, so she'll now be our first speaker this morning.
Oh, and one more thing. Can I ask you to put your tea and coffee cups back on the drink station after each break?
It will help our kitchen staff enormously.
One. Why is Dr. Carlton unable to give his lecture this morning?
Two. Look at the graphic. At what time will the urban partnerships session begin?
Three. What does the speaker ask listeners to do?
