Questions about suggestions and advice?
1.
Haven't you found a job yet, Craig?
No, I haven't. I can't seem to find anything.
There aren't any good jobs in the newspapers, and the employment agencies are useless.
There are a lot of job sites on the web. Why don't you look there? That's how I found my job.
Of course. The Internet. Why didn't I think of that?
1. What does the woman suggest Craig do to find a job?
2.
I'm going to the airport to pick up Mr. Chan again.
Wow. That's the third time this month.
I know. And it's getting in the way of my work.
I'm already behind schedule.
If I were you, I'd find a good taxi company and get them to meet him.
2. What does the woman advise the man to do?
3.
You know, I've done the same job since I started here five years ago.
I'm getting bored, but I don't want to leave the company.
Isn't there a vacancy in media relations? I saw an ad on the bulletin board in the cafeteria.
Yes, I saw that too. I don't think I'm qualified for it though.
Maybe you should ask them about it. You might have the skills they need.

4.
Oh, this office is so small. I'm surprised you haven't moved by now.
There are only three of us. We don't need a lot of space, you know.
Have you considered moving someplace bigger and closer to the city?
It would be more convenient for your clients.
Yes, but it would also cost more money. I don't think we can afford it.

What do we do for the end of the year party? Do you have any ideas?
We usually have drinks and snacks in the conference room on the last day, don't we?
Yes, but this year I want us all to do something different. What about a dance competition?
How about eating out for a change? We could have dinner at the new Italian place across the street.

What's the best way to get to house and chemicals from here?
If I were you, I'd catch a train to Newberry and then walk there from the station.
It's not far and quicker than the bus.
Oh, okay. I was thinking of driving, actually.
Don't. The traffic is terrible. When I drove there, it took two hours.
