Questions about reasons.
One.
What's wrong? You look a little upset.
It's this new filing system. It's not very good.
A lot of documents seem to be missing.
You're right. It's not easy to use.
I think the old system was much better.
I'll have to ask senior management to look into it.
It's time you put all these records on the computer anyway.
One. Why is the man unhappy?
Two.
Aishan, I hear you moved home last week. Congratulations.
Thanks. It's a smaller place than I was in though.
But don't you find it's more convenient to be in the city?
Yes, that's why I moved. I love the countryside.
But it used to take 40 minutes to get here on the train.
But now I walk to work.
Two. Why did Sean move home?
Three.
Why are we meeting on Friday and not today as we planned?
James can't make it today. He's away at a convention.
Can't we manage without him?
Not really. The main office says we all have to attend the meeting.
Three. Why is the meeting delayed?
Four.
Don't you want to leave? It's 7.30. Everyone's gone home.
I have to wait for a client to call.
It's the Jenkins account. Again.
Oh, really? What's the problem this time?
They're saying they won't pay our latest invoice.
Four. Why is the woman working late?
Five.
Have you heard the news about Michael Fraser?
He resigned.
No. He's only been here six months. What happened?
I have no idea. But they're already advertising for a new research director.
Five. Why is the woman surprised?
Six.
Hello. Barbara Redditch speaking.
Hi, Barbara. It's Brian. I won't be in today. I have a really bad stomach ache.
I'm seeing the doctor later this morning.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell the others.
Oh, what about your annual review?
It'll have to wait. Can we just reschedule it for next week?
Six. Why is Brian unable to come to the office?
